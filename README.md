#This project revolved around students at different schools/districts, and creating an analysis around the High-Performing Schools, Bottom Performing School, School Spending, School Size, School Type.

-Overall, the data analysis highlights the differences in academic performance and funding between district and charter schools. It also emphasizes the need for further investigation into the factors that contribute to student success, beyond financial resources.

-Conclusion 1: School type affects academic performance. Comparing the average math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall, between district schools and charter schools, it can be observed that charter schools generally outperform district schools. Cabrera High School, a charter school, consistently has higher average scores and passing rates compared to Bailey High School, a district school. This suggests that the type of school can have an impact on student achievement.

-Conclusion 2: There is no strong correlation between per-student spending and academic performance. Comparing the average math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall, across different spending ranges per student, there is no clear trend indicating that higher spending per student leads to better academic outcomes. For example, Cabrera High School, with a per-student budget of $582, outperforms Rodriguez High School, which has a higher per-student budget of $637. This suggests that factors other than spending, such as school management, teaching quality, and student support, may play a more significant role in determining academic performance.
